<h3>This is a fork of the libcds library</h3>

The original library was written by Francisco Claude (https://github.com/fclaude/libcds). 

This version has just minor changes:
- BitsequenceRGK (a 2x faster uncompressed bitsequence for select queries)
- CMake compatible build system
- range_sum queries for Wavelet trees
- Other range queries for Wavelet trees implemented by Francisco Claude, Mathias Petri and myself.
